Purpose:  The purpose of this program is to allow users to upload their own images to a photo slider

Use:  The ideal image size are images of size 728 x 307 (there are stock images in the images folder of this repository).
      The user will upload the file and then select add image, which will then display the image, as the user adds
      more images, the arrows will allow the user to cycle through these images.
      
Future updates include the ability to remove an image and also the ability to cycle through these images via slideshow-esque functionality
